SwadeshLists
============

This is simple table data that maps different Swadesh lists onto common concepts. At the moment, I'm not sure where it will lead in the end, but we start with simple concept-string mappings for all items in different Swadesh lists that may later be expanded by additional rankings and the like.

Currently, all data contained in the folder of separate Swadesh lists is provided in a simple tab-delimited text format: [swadesh_lists.tsv](https://github.com/LinguList/SwadeshLists/blob/master/swadesh_list.tsv). A more verbose fileformat for the data is also accessible as [swadesh_lists.qlc](https://github.com/LinguList/SwadeshLists/blob/master/swadesh_lists.qlc). This format can be used for parsing it in [LingPy](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy). The simple table format lists a basic gloss and a unique ID in the first two columns, and the items for all lists currently combined in the following columns. Numbers that are provided with the original lists are added in greate/less-brackets after the entry.

The references for all files are not yet complete and will be added in the future.
